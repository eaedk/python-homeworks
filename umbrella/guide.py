    # The weather list may contain wrong number of weathers
    # if a bad weather variable is passed: # len(weather)%3 is 0 if the length of weather is not a multiple of 3
        # raise an error

    # when the weather list is fine for processing
        # iterate through the passed weather list
        # loop: # big loop to iterate over the days: [day 1, day 2, etc ...]
